# OpenGL Educational Project

A **simple OpenGL application written in C++** that demonstrates the fundamentals of modern graphics programming. It renders a basic **3D plate geometry object** with applied **textures, shaders, and lighting**, while keeping the code clear and beginner-friendly.

This project was created for **educational purposes** and serves as a foundation for learning graphics programming in OpenGL.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Basic geometry rendering (plate object)
* ✅ Texture mapping with **stb\_image**
* ✅ Custom GLSL shaders (vertex + fragment)
* ✅ Simple lighting model (diffuse & specular)
* ✅ Interactive UI with **Dear ImGui**

## 📖 Purpose

This repository is intended as a **learning resource** for those who want to understand:

* OpenGL fundamentals
* Working with shaders and the GPU pipeline
* Applying and managing textures in C++
* Adding a user interface overlay for visualization/debugging

## 🛠️ Dependencies

* **OpenGL** (core profile)
* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) – windowing and input
* [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) – OpenGL function loader
* [stb\_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) – image loading
* [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) – simple UI overlay
